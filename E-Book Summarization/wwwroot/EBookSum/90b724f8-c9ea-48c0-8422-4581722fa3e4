chapter 1: introduction
The narrator tells us that the dream of being rich is the startingpoint of his life. He writes a letter for the manufacturer of hearing devices to say that they have grown rich to be rich. "the depression brought you an opportunity to teach humble humility in ascendancy of this world" , he notes. In other words, it's not just about wanting to become rich but also about becoming useful to the people around him. This is how he got into business with Edison: he wanted to do what was right for him and make use of the resources he had on hand. But he didn't want to become the partner because he thought he would go through with it. So he went back to working at edisson again. Now he wants to help people hear and speak better. He attends a class for the deaf community where he learns from the professors how to communicate with the hard-of-hearing.
